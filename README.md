# mock-personal-page

A mock personal page I wanted to whip up with a simple tabbed component. This isn't deployed anywhere, so you'll have to download the files and load up the .html file in your browser of choice.

## Repo contains:

- HTML file

- src folder with:

  - CSS file
  - JavaScript file

## To-Do:

- Make the contact form functional (first step for this is learning how to do so...)

- Add some animated styling to the tabs for hovering

- I'll probably change the whole color scheme, too
